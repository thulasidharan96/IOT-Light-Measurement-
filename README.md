# IoT Light Measurement with Lux Sensor and ESP32

## Overview
This project aims to develop an IoT-based light measurement system using a lux sensor and ESP32. It's designed to capture light intensity data and transmit it over the internet for remote monitoring.

## Components
- **ESP32**: The main microcontroller used for processing and connectivity.
- **Lux Sensor**: A sensor that measures the intensity of light.

## Setup
1. **Hardware Assembly**: Connect the lux sensor to the ESP32 according to the provided schematics.
2. **Software Configuration**: Upload the `sketch.ino` file to the ESP32.

## Usage
Once set up, the device will measure the ambient light intensity and send the data to a configured server or cloud service.
